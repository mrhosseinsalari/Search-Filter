This project developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

In order for the project to work properly, you need to do the following because my project uses a local api and you need to use the json-server package to connect to it :

1. Install JSON Server

```
npm install -g json-server
```

2. Start JSON Server

```
json-server --watch db.json
```

Now you can run the application !
